This post is a Google Colab notebook showing how to visualize a neural network as it trains.
It's personally been really useful to me as a convenient tool for both debugging and building intuition.
Shown below is a simple feedforward neural network attempting to fit the function f(x,y) = x^2 - cos(y)
