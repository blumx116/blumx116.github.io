Level-design can make or break a game.
Many games either design levels manually or use complicated algorithms to generate new areas for players to explore.
Both of these approaches can be expensive, costing a lot of human labor to implement.
Can we automate the process using reinforcement learning?

## Background

As I'm sure most people our generation don't need to be told, many games are organized in to levels.
Levels serve as nice, discrete tasks that the player must complete before progressing on to the next one.
These levels should ideally be just difficult enough to solve that the player feels like they made progress, but not so hard that the player gets frustrated.
Above all else, these levels should be solvable - there's little that's more frustrating than spending hours solving a problem solving a puzzle that can't be solved.

These levels are usually created either by algorithms that procedurally place objects in a level or by people who have to hand-place every single object in the game (or some mixture of those two).
