## What's all of this about?

This is the first of a series of blog posts in which I'll try to write out my thoughts on some ineresting problems.
These posts aren't meant to be rigorous analyses of their respective topics.
Instead, the goals is to identify and formulate a problem, typically one that is focused on machine intelligence or a related subject.


## On to the Main Topic

In this post, I'd like to talk about creativity - an elusive idea that is often touted as 'uniquely human'.
Many people are excited that new technologies (such as generative adversarial networks (GANs)[^GAN], invertible flow networks, and variational autoencoders (VAEs)[^VAE]) might finally grant machines some form of creativity.

[^GAN]: [Goodfellow et Al. - Generative Adversarial Nets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf)
[^VAE]: [Kingma et Al. - Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf)
